I believe the measure in Table S0901 only includes individuals in households. I am not sure exactly how a child can be in poverty if they are not in a household because presumably they would be in group quarters which I thought were not included in poverty estimations. Regardless, I believe the measure in Table S1701 is the one which should normally be used if one is interested in rates of child poverty.
